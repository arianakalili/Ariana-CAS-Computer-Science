I think one of the biggest challenges would be that ranking system. There would have to be some kind of selection process before people can vote on them because there would be no way for users to comb through all the options. Also making the template builder easy to use may be difficult so there would have to be some software that auto smoothes out the lines so people do have shakey awkwardly drawn designs.
