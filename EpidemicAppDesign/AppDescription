I think an app where you can color in and design outline drawings that others could add on to would be fun and give people in quarantine something to do.


Feature List:
A person who opens the app should be able to login/create an account and see all their saved drawings.
When a person wants to make a new drawing they should have the option between built-in templates, user-created templates, or creating their own.
If a person chooses to create a new template they can either sketch it using their mouse or an apple pencil, upload an image and vectorize it (and still be able to edit it), choose certain built-in patterns/shapes to add or modify an existing user-created template.
When a person is coloring in their drawing they should have a color wheel so that they can pick whatever color they want.
When someone is done working on their drawing they should be able to share it with someone else to either show their finished are or to have them add on to it.
There should be a public ranking of each days best work based on user voting for different pieces that people submit.
Users should be able to leave comments and vote on the drawings that people publically submit.
Users should be able to print out their drawings.
The app should be able to be used on any Apple device.
There should be comment moderating to avoid mean comments.


The layout would be similar to the Pages layout where you see a preview of the various templates and can use the sidebar to shift between self-created, other user-created, and built-in templates.
